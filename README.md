# pwntomate
Automate pwnage, but documentation first!
Preparing for the first prototype.

## Abstract
pwntomate is a tool for automatic penetration testing. Example use case: You have a lot of servers, with a bunch of services. First you scan with nmap, then you filter all https and finally you pass these to sslyze, right? This can become easily a tedious task. So pwntomate might help. Other security frameworks could be used, but most time they are very heavy.
