# pwntomate üçÖ
Automate pwnage!
Feel free to test the third prototype.

## Abstract 
pwntomate is a tool for penetration testing automation. Example use case: You have a lot of servers, with a bunch of services. First you scan with nmap, then you filter all https and finally you pass these to sslyze, right? This can become easily a tedious task. So pwntomate might help. Other security frameworks could be used, but most time they are very heavy.
